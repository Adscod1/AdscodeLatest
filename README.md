BACKEND WORK FLOW
Influencer Campaign

Core Problem: What is the single most important problem this feature should solve in its very first version? Is it simply to allow brands to create campaigns and influencers to apply, or is the financial transaction (escrow and payout) a must-have from day one?

MVP Scope: The document describes a full journey from campaign creation to payment, fraud detection, and analytics. Which of these user flows represents the absolute minimum for our first release?

Option A (Marketplace): A brand can create a campaign, and an influencer can apply. The rest is handled offline.
Option B (Marketplace with Simple Escrow): Everything in A, plus a brand can deposit the total budget, and the influencer gets paid the full amount upon campaign completion (no complex milestones).
Option C (Full Milestone System): The full, complex system with milestone-based payouts as described.
User Stories: Could you provide one critical user story for a brand and one for an influencer that you want to see fulfilled in this first version? For example:

Brand: "As a brand, I want to publish a campaign with a set budget so that relevant influencers can apply."
Influencer: "As an influencer, I want to see and apply for campaigns that match my niche so I can earn money."
Success Criteria: What are the top 1-2 things we must see working perfectly to consider this first version a success? (e.g., "A brand can successfully select an influencer for their campaign," or "An influencer successfully receives payment after a campaign is marked complete.")

Data & UI: For the first version, is it acceptable to focus only on the core data models like Campaign and CampaignInfluencer? Also, are there any existing UI mockups, or should the developer follow the existing application's style?


NB: 
 I have excluded complex features like payments, milestones, and analytics to ensure the initial scope is manageable.
